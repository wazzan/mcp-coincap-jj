# Upgrade Plan for mcp-coincap-jj

This document outlines the steps to rebrand and imrprove the forked npm package from "mcp-crypto-price" to "mcp-coincap-jj".

## Detailed Plan for Rebranding the Package

Completed Basic Rebrand by changing package name, author name, version etc.

### Update src/index.ts
- Keep the tool names and functionality the same for now

### Update GitHub Workflows
- Review the workflows to ensure they'll work with your repository
- Note that you'll need to set up NPM_TOKEN in your GitHub repository settings

### Testing and Publishing
- Build and test the package locally
- Prepare for npm publishing

## Implementation Sequence

1. First, update configuration files (package.json, src/config/index.ts)
2. Then, update source code (src/index.ts)
3. Next, update documentation (README.md)
4. Finally, update CI/CD configuration (GitHub workflows, Dockerfile)
5. Test the changes locally before publishing

## Future Considerations

After the initial rebranding, consider:
- Adding new features or improvements
- Updating the API integration
- Enhancing documentation
- Setting up proper CI/CD with your GitHub repository
