# CoinCap API v3 Migration - Completed

## Background
We successfully upgraded from CoinCap API v2 to v3. This document details the changes made and the results of our implementation.

## Issues Identified and Fixed
- Base URL was updated from `api.coincap.io/v2` to `rest.coincap.io/v3`
- Configuration incorrectly set `COINCAP_API_BASE = "https://rest.coincap.io/v3/assets"`, which caused endpoint construction problems
- API v3 requires authentication with a bearer token (this part was already implemented correctly)
- V3 API response includes a timestamp field not present in type definitions, but our implementation handles this gracefully

## Completed Migration Steps

### Step 1: Updated Base URL Configuration ✅
- Changed base URL in `src/config/index.ts` from `"https://rest.coincap.io/v3/assets"` to `"https://rest.coincap.io/v3"`
- This fixed the endpoint path construction, preventing issues like `https://rest.coincap.io/v3/assets/assets`

### Step 2: Type Definition Analysis ✅
- We tested all functionality without updating type definitions
- The codebase gracefully handles the additional timestamp field in the API response
- No changes were needed in type definitions, making our migration more backward compatible

### Step 3: Testing ✅
- All tools function properly with the updated base URL
- Data is fetched correctly from the v3 API
- The MCP server processes and formats the data as expected

## Verification Results
- ✅ `get-crypto-price` tool works correctly and displays current BTC price and statistics
- ✅ `get-market-analysis` tool successfully retrieves and displays market data for ETH
- ✅ `get-historical-analysis` tool accurately fetches and displays historical data for SOL

## Technical Notes
- The authorization header with `Bearer ${apiKey}` is functioning correctly
- Environment variables for API key are correctly set in MCP configuration
- Despite the API response including a timestamp field, our existing code handles it without modifications

## Conclusion
The migration to CoinCap API v3 was successful with a minimal code change. The only required modification was updating the base URL in the configuration. This demonstrates the robustness of the original implementation, which was able to handle the additional data in the API response without needing further changes.
