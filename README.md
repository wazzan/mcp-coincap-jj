A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis using the CoinCap API. This server offers real-time price data, market analysis, and historical trends through an easy-to-use interface.

## üìå About This Fork

This is a fork of the original [mcp-crypto-price](https://github.com/truss44/mcp-crypto-price) project by Tracey Russell

‚úÖ What‚Äôs changed:
   - Updated to use the CoinCap v3 API (as v2 is being sunset).
   - Additional improvements and testing planned as time permits.

üí° Shoutout to Coin Cap for their ‚Äústake-to-API‚Äù subscription model‚Äîsomething I hope more API providers adopt. Subscription fatigue is real!

> **Package Note**: This project is hosted on GitHub as `wazzan/mcp-coincap-jj` but published to npm as `@bujaayjaay/mcp-coincap-jj`

## üöÄ Quick Start (For First-Time Users)

If you‚Äôre new to MCP servers, this guide provides step-by-step instructions to get you started.

I tested this on a Windows 11 VM to avoid cluttering my Mac‚Äîworked flawlessly!

Claude Desktop Config Locations:

- **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

--- 
üü¢ **Windows Setup Guide (Same Steps for Any MCP Client)**

1.	Install Node.js: (https://nodejs.org/en)
2.	Install Claude Desktop
3.	Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open the hamburger menu (top-left corner) ‚Üí File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config
   - This opens the claude_desktop_config.json file location in Windows Explorer.
   - Edit it with your favorite editor and add the following configuration (make sure to include all closing braces!):

> Note you can use these same instructions for any other MCP Client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-coincap-jj": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@bujaayjaay/mcp-coincap-jj"
      ],
      "env": {
        "COINCAP_API_KEY": "INPUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è  Developer Setup (Local Installation)

For developers and contributors who want to work on the project locally:

##### üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Install From npm

```bash
npm install @bujaayjaay/mcp-coincap-jj
```

##### üñ•Ô∏è Option 2: Clone & Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wazzan/mcp-coincap-jj.git
cd mcp-coincap-jj
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript code
npm test           # Run tests to verify everything works
npm start          # Starts the MCP server locally
```

MCP Server Config for Local Testing (Windows Example)
- If running locally with npx, use this configuration in Claude Desktop (or any MCP client):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-coincap-jj": {
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
        "C:\\Users\\YOUR-WINDOWS-USERNAME\\repos\\github\\mcp-coincap-jj"
      ],
      "env": {
        "COINCAP_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": []
    }
  }
}
```
üîß Pro Tip: Using absolute paths on Windows ensures a smooth experience, especially when running multiple environments.

### Smithery Installation (Optional but Easy)

Although it takes away some of the personal learning experience, it‚Äôs a great quick start!

1. Ensure you have Smithery installed for your Claude Desktop app
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   smithery install @bujaayjaay/mcp-coincap-jj
   ```
3. You'll be prompted to enter your CoinCap API key during setup

## UPDATE: CoinCap API Key

You now have to obtain an API Key from CoinCap to use the updated v3 API as v2 is being deprecated:
